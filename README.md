# Hi-Lo CLI Game

This is a command line game where a user tried to guess a number within a specific range (ex: 1-10). After they enter a number, the computer gives them X guesses to get it right. The computer prompts the user with 'go higher' or 'go lower' to help with guesses.

There are tests for this game. Use them to help you build it.
